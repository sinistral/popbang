# Pop!

Pop! is an experiment in building a serverless web application in
[ClojureScript], using [AWS] managed services.  [AWS Lambda] in particular is a
crucial element of the architecture, providing serverless compute resources.

The application will ultimately provide a simple interface to capture expenses
and track spending over time.

# Why *Pop!*?

The name is a reference to the English nursery rhyme
*[Pop! goes the weasel][pop!]*, the first verse of which describes spending
according to a rather meagre budget.
